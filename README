This bot builds haikus on the fly from a sample of the twitter public timeline. 
It uses Blei's implementation of online LDA to assign tweets a topic, and if it can find two other tweets with the same topic and compatible syllables (i.e. 5-7-5), 
it concats them and pushes them to the twitter handle over tweepy. 
Otherwise, the tweet is stored in mongo alongside its assigned topic (and hashtag if available), and the process continues.
